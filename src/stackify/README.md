apache-config
=============

A simple config parser for Apache HTTP Server config files.

https://github.com/stackify/apache-config

Usage
-----
The parser builds a tree of apache configuration.  So, for example, if you wanted to find all of the virtual hosts you could do the following.

```java
InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(new File("/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"));

ApacheConfigParser parser = new ApacheConfigParser();
ConfigNode config = parser.parse(inputStream);

for (ConfigNode child : config.getChildren()) {
	if (child.getName().equals("VirtualHost")) {
    	System.out.println(child.getContent());
    }
}
```
